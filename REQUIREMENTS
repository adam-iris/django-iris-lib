### Customized libraries from IRIS Github
#
# These are generally for libraries that are available from Github, but have not released
# a new version in a while.  In this situation, pip has to either grab an arbitrary
# commit (which requires git, so it won't work on the production host anyway), or get the latest
# master, which means that different machines may have different versions.
#
# Instead, we fork the project using the iris-edu account, and release a version from there.
# This ensures that we have a stable codebase for the library, and because versions are
# available as tarballs via HTTP, we can deploy to the production host.
#
# The only issue here is that pip doesn't record the URL that the library came from, only the
# stated version number (see https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/452).
# Ex:
# > pip install https://github.com/iris-edu/python-textile/archive/v2.1.8.tar.gz#egg=textile==2.1.8
# > pip freeze
# textile==2.1.8
#
# For this reason, the general pattern here is that our release tag is one version above the
# last public release, adds an "-iris" suffix, and is marked as a prerelease.
# eg. if the last released version is 1.3.0, our tag is 1.4.0-iris
#
